    /*
    Write a method named isPerfectNumber with
    one parameter of type int named number.
    If number is < 1, the method should return false.
    The method must calculate if the number is perfect.
    If the number is perfect, the method should return true;
    otherwise, it should return false.

        EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
        •	isPerfectNumber(6); should return true since its proper
            divisors are 1, 2, 3 and the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
        •	isPerfectNumber(28); should return true since its
            proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
        •	isPerfectNumber(5); should return false since its
            only proper divisor is 1 and the sum is 1 not 5
        •	isPerfectNumber(-1); should return false since the number is < 1

        HINT: Use a while or for loop.
        HINT: Use the remainder operator.
        NOTE: The method isPerfectNumber should be defined as
                public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
        NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
